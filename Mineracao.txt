schematics: showing the main form and features of something, usually in the form of a drawing, in a way that helps people to understand it (esquema, planta, diagrama). 
I know the schematics of this building better than anyone. I can find them.
expendable /ɪkˈspendəbl/: if you consider people or things to be expendable, you think that you can get rid of them when they are no longer needed, or think it is acceptable if they are killed or destroyed. Either way, you and I are equally expendable.
dampen /ˈdæmpən/: dampen something to make something slightly wet (umedecer, amortecer, molhar, diminuir). If necessary, you can also lightly dampen the cloth with fresh water.
depleted /dɪˈpliːt/: to reduce something by a large amount so that there is not enough left; to be reduced by a large amount. Perhaps its power source has been depleted.
outcome /ˈaʊtkʌm/: the result or effect of an action or event. We are confident of a positive outcome.
overnight /ˌəʊvərˈnaɪt/: for or during the entire night. We stayed overnight in London after the theatre. 
complaint: a reason for not being satisfied; a statement that somebody makes saying that they are not satisfied. I have a complaint about the food.
countertop /ˈkaʊntərtɑːp/: a flat surface in a kitchen for preparing food on. We'll be sure to clean the countertop.
snatchers /ˈsnætʃər/: a person who takes something quickly with their hand and steals it. I know you're the one who caught those child snatchers.
craziness /ˈkreɪzinəs/: behaviour or ideas that are stupid or not sensible. I get tired of all the craziness in Hollywood.
